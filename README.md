# eCommerce Store back-end using Node.js, Express, PostGresSQL

Node/Express REST API to provide typical functionality found in an eCommerce website. Users can create accounts, view products, add products to a cart, and place/view orders.

## Running the app

To run locally, `npm install`, then `npm run start`

This project requires a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database to be running locally. Reference the ERD diagram located in the `resources` folder of this repo to view the structure of the tables. You can use [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to interact with the database manually.

This repo includes an `example.env` file that contains important environment variables for reference. Make sure to create a `.env` file and include all variables found in the `example.env` file, replacing the example values with those specific to your environment/needs.

To easily populate your database with the requisite tables, `npm run create-db`. This will create tables in your database if they do not already exist. The configuration for this script can be found in the `setupDatabase.js` file located in the root of this project. In addition, you can run `npm run seed-db` from the root directory to seed the database.

Once the app is running locally, you can access the API at `http://localhost:<your-port>`
